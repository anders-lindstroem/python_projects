# Python 
This repository includes a curated selection of my work within the realm of programming, data- and quantitative analysis, 
with an emphasis on finance-related topics.

The files includes in-depth comments that serve the function of explaining the itention and useability of the file, 
as well as explaining the purpose and function of a given line of code.

The repository is to be seen as a portfolio of my works,
and the intended recipient and reader of these files are anyone with an interest in my works within programming.

Any comments or inputs are warmly welcomed!
